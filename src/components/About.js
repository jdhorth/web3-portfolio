            <p>
                Welcome and thanks for surfing by. I am a born again web3 developer. I dove down the NFT and crypto rabbit hole and along the way built Non-Fungi.com. Some tutorial projects I've followed by awesome channels including EatTheBlocks, Dapp University, The Net Ninja, Traversy Media, Kevin Powell, Colby Fayock, freecodecamp and many more. I really appreciate all the educational and inspirational channels available! I'm excited to learn new web2 and web3 skills. I enjoy HTML, CSS, Javascript, frameworks, React, Nextjs, Gatsby, some Vue3 and am also interested in blockchain developments and NFTs. This is a new web3 porfolio project.
