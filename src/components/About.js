            <p>
                I am aspiring freelance musician and web2 / web3 developer / service tech / creative. I dove down the NFT and crypto rabbit hole and built and blogged on Non-Fungi.com. Some tutorial projects I've followed include EatTheBlocks, Dapp University, The Net Ninja, Traversy Media, Kevin Powell, Colby Fayock, Ania Kubow, freecodecamp and many more. I really appreciate all the educational and inspirational channels, blogs, videos and content available! I'm excited to learn new web2 and web3 skills. I enjoy HTML, CSS, Javascript, frameworks, have done tutorials in React, Nextjs, Gatsby, some Vue3, Svelte, Solid and so on, and am also interested in blockchain developments and NFTs. This is a new web3 porfolio project.
